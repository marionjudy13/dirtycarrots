# Connecting to a Weather API

## Here's what I think I need to do:
1. Determine the location of the user.
2. Get the user's weather information from a weather API 
3. Parse the information so I can grab only the data I want.
4. Put that data in my weather component.
5. Repeat daily or everytime a user loads the page?
